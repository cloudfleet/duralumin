Cloudfleet's UI.

Design guidelines
-----------------
Victorian, with grace.

[satadev](http://www.satadev.com/about/) - crispy, with an occasional hint of
hand-drawn trinketry.

[Valve's handbook](http://media.steampowered.com/apps/valve/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf)
- some nice hand-pressed goodness.

[Franz Ferdinand - Eleanor Put Your Boots On, video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQHdSfSRKw)
- parallax, cardboard-collage show of semi-transparent
clouds, kites and airships
